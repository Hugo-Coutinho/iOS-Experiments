# ðŸ§ª iOS Experiments

A collection of small projects, prototypes, and playgrounds where I explore **iOS development concepts**, try out **new APIs**, and test **architecture patterns**.  

This repository is not meant to be a polished app â€” itâ€™s my **sandbox for learning, experimenting, and sharing code** that might later evolve into production-ready code.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Explore new **Swift / iOS frameworks** (swift 6, Concurrency, SwiftUI, Combine, SwiftData, etc.)
- Experiment with **architecture patterns** like MVVM, VIPER, Clean Architecture
- Test **UI components**, animations, and layout techniques
- Practice **best practices** with code organization and testing

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each experiment lives in its **own folder**, with a short README describing the idea behind it.
